# 📝 Abstractive Text Summarization Model  
This project fine-tunes a **pretrained Transformer model (T5-small)** for **abstractive text summarization**.  
It generates human-like summaries instead of extracting sentences from the original text.

### 🚀 **How the Model Works (Step-by-Step Explanation)**  

### **1️⃣ Dataset Preparation**  
- The model is trained using a **text-summary dataset** such as **CNN/DailyMail** or **XSum**.  
- Each dataset sample consists of:  
  - **Input Text (Article)** → The long text that needs to be summarized.  
  - **Ground Truth Summary** → The human-written summary of the article.  
- This dataset helps the model learn how to generate summaries in a way that resembles human writing.

### **2️⃣ Preprocessing (Tokenization & Formatting)**  
- The input text is **converted into numerical representations** (tokens) using a tokenizer.  
- A special prefix `"summarize: "` is added to the input text to indicate that the task is summarization.  
- The tokenized text is then **truncated** to a maximum length (e.g., 512 tokens) to ensure it fits within the model’s processing capacity.  
- **Padding** is applied so that all sequences in a batch have the same length, preventing training errors.

### **3️⃣ Fine-Tuning Process**  
- A **pretrained Transformer model** (such as T5 or BART) is fine-tuned on the dataset to generate high-quality summaries.  
- During training, the model:  
  - **Processes the input text** and attempts to generate a summary.  
  - **Compares the generated summary** with the ground truth summary.  
  - **Computes the loss** (difference between the predicted and actual summary).  
  - **Adjusts model weights** using optimization techniques to minimize errors.  
- The model gradually improves over multiple training iterations (epochs), learning to produce better summaries.

### **4️⃣ Generating Summaries with the Fine-Tuned Model**  
- Once training is complete, the model can generate summaries for new, unseen text.  
- When given an input text, the model:  
  - **Processes the text through its trained layers** to understand key information.  
  - **Applies attention mechanisms** to focus on the most relevant parts of the text.  
  - **Generates a compressed version** of the original text while maintaining key meaning.  
- The final output is a **coherent, fluent, and concise summary** of the input text.  

---

### **5️⃣ Evaluating the Model (ROUGE Score)**  
- The quality of the generated summaries is measured using **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**.  
- This metric **compares the generated summary** with the ground truth summary by checking overlapping words and phrases.  
- **Higher ROUGE scores indicate better summarization quality**, meaning the model-generated summaries closely match human-written ones.  
- If the performance is not satisfactory, further **hyperparameter tuning** or additional training on a **larger dataset** may be needed.
